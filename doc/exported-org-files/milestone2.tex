This document is for explaining the design decisions we had to make
whilst implementing the components for milestone 2.  \newpage
\section{Weeding}
\label{sec:org44c5fe7}
We implemented additional weeding passes for certain constraints
that could be verified either at the weeding level or the typecheck
level because it was easier to check via weeding. The constraints we
checked in weeding for this milestone are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Correct use of the blank identifier. It was much easier to recurse
through the AST and gather all identifiers that cannot be blank
and then just check this whole list. Additionally, because we have
offsets in our AST, we could easily point to the offending blank
identifier without having to make error messages for each specific
incorrect usage, as it is obvious what the incorrect usage when we
print out where the blank identifier is.
\item Function bodies ending in return statements. It was easier to do
a single weeding pass because otherwise we'd have to recurse
differently on functions that have a return type versus functions
that don't have a return type during typechecking. Essentially,
we'd need two versions of typechecking statements, which was not
deemed worth it compared to a single weeding pass.
\item \texttt{init} function declaration not having any non void return
statements. Similar argument to the above, it is easier to do a
weeding pass then require context/a different traversal function
given the context of our current function.
\item `main` function cannot return non void. Straightforward weeding
check. Could also have been done via typecheck, but it is slightly
easier to implement weeding passes (no symbol table required).
\end{itemize}
\section{Symbol Table}
\label{sec:org155f242}
In Haskell, data structures are typically immutable, and much of the
language is designed around this. One of the main design decisions
made around the symbol table was deciding whether to go with an
immutable or mutable symbol table. In an immutable symbol table, a
new symbol table would have to be made every time a scope is added
or modified. Right away, despite this being a conceptually better
fit for the language, the potential performance degradation of
constantly re-building the symbol table becomes evident.

As a result of this performance impact, we decided on using a
mutable symbol table, with mutability supported via Haskell's \href{https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.12.0.0/docs/Control-Monad-ST.html}{ST}
monad. The constraint provided for \href{https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.12.0.0/docs/Control-Monad-ST.html\#v:runST}{runST} (which removes the \texttt{ST} (or
mutability) from something) is proven to keep functions pure (see
\href{https://iris-project.org/pdfs/2018-popl-runST-final.pdf}{A Logical
Relation for Monadic Encapsulation of State by Amin Timany et
al.}). This made the \texttt{ST} monad a better choice than other monads
providing mutability (the main example being \texttt{IO}, but if we used
\texttt{IO} then all our functions after the symbol table generation would
be bound by \texttt{IO}, i.e. impure and also harder to deal with as they
are wrapped by an unnecessary monad). The trade-off of this decision
was a large increase in the difficulty implementing the symbol
table, which made up a huge portion of the work for this milestone,
however, once we finish using the symbol table, our final result (a
typechecked/simplified proven correct AST) is pure and very easy to
manipulate for \texttt{codegen} in the next milestone.

As for what we store in the symbol table, we created a new type
\texttt{Symbol} to represent each symbol, analogous to the different types
of symbols (types, constants, functions, variables) and new type
\texttt{SType} that keeps the vital information concerning the types we
define in the original \texttt{AST}. All types that are left to be inferred
during symbol table generation are updated when typechecking (we
infer the type of variables and then update their value in the
symbol table to make sure things like assignments don't conflict
with the original inferred type).
\subsection{Scoping Rules}
\label{sec:org5e3c3a1}
The scoping rules we used/considered are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Function declarations: the parameters and function body are put
in a new scope, but the function itself is declared at the
current scope. Note that here we had to treat the function body
as a list of statements and not a block statement, because if we
recursed on the block statement our block statement rule would
put the function body in a new scope, but it has to be in the
same scope as the parameters.
\item Block statements are put into a new scope
\item If statements: we open a new scope (containing the simple
statement and expression condition at the top level) and then
another scope inside for the body/bodies (one for if, one for
else if there's one, in that case the if and else scope are
siblings).
\item Switch statements: open a new scope and another scope for each
switch case (all switch cases have sibling scopes to each other)
\item For loop: open a new scope, optional clauses are put at the top
level (simple statement 1 and 2 and condition) and the body is
put in a nested scope
\end{itemize}
\section{Type Checker}
\label{sec:org923c04d}
For type-checking, we decided on a single-pass approach which
combined symbol table generation and statement type-checking. This
improves performance, and is possible as a product of GoLite's
declaration rules, which specify that identifiers must be declared
before they can be used. The other approach we considered was having
a type annotated AST (types of expressions would be contained in the
AST) so that we could get rid of mutability (the symbol table) as
soon as possible (also some of us did a similar thing for the
assignment, but this was mainly relevant for the fact that print
statements in codegen need to know the type of the expression
they're printing in C), however we decided on doing all the
typechecking at the same time as symbol table generation because
type inference has to be done to generate this new AST and type
inference requires typechecking (\texttt{"a" + 5} has no inferred type, but
we only know that because we typecheck it). Therefore we'd generate
an annotated AST only to typecheck things that aren't
expressions. But at that point, since we are already doing one
in-depth pass of the original AST when generating the symbol table,
we might as well do the other half of typechecking at the same phase
(it seemed weird to split half of typechecking with a symbol table
and half without it and might have been more feasible if type
inference did not require typechecking, but that makes no
sense). Therefore, after the one pass of our original AST, the final
result is a typechecked AST with no type annotation.

Additionally, we decided to resolve all type mappings (except for
structs) to their base types when generating this new AST (all the
casts/equality checks/new type usages are already validated in
typechecking, so we don't need them anymore, nor do we need the
mappings). Therefore our new AST was also able to get rid of type
declarations (except for structs).
\section{New AST}
\label{sec:org1687bb2}
As mentioned above, dependency on the SymbolTable results in a
dependency on the ST monad, which adds complexity to each operation.
As a result, our goal after typechecking is to create a new AST,
which reflects the new constraints we enforce.  Namely:
\begin{itemize}
\item Typecheck errors are caught beforehand, so we no longer need offsets,
or error breakpoints.
\item All variables are properly typechecked, and can therefore reference an 
explicit type. Each type is composed of parent types up until
the primitives.  This includes cases like function signatures,
where we can associate each parameter with a type instead of
allowing lists of identifiers to map to a single type.  In
preparation for codegen, we can then use our new AST
exclusively, without any other mutable data structures. Any
additinoal information we need can be added back into the AST,
with minimal changes to models used at previous stages.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Team Organization}
\label{sec:orge17ae2f}
The three main components for this milestone are the symbol table,
type checking rules, and new AST + tests.  Each component was lead
by Julian, David, and Allan respectively. As there is high coupling
between each component, we continually sought feedback from one
another. Leads are in charge of understanding the overall component
and in resolving concerns or requests from other members.
