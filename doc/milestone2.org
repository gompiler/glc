This document is for explaining the design decisions we had to make
whilst implementing the components for milestone 2.

** Type Checker
TODO
** Invalid Programs
Summary of the check in each invalid program:
- ~append-diff-type.go~: Append an expression of a different type than
  the type of the expressions of the ~slice~.
- ~append-no-slice.go~: Append to something that isn't a slice.
- ~assign-no-decl.go~: Assign to a variable that hasn't been declared.
- ~assign-non-addressable.go~: Assign to a LHS that is a
  non-addressable field.
- ~cast-not-base.go~: Cast to a type that isn't a base type.
- ~dec-non-lval.go~: Decrement something that isn't an ~lvalue~.
- ~decl-type-mismatch.go~: Declare and assign variable of explicit type
  to an expression of a different type.
- ~float-to-string.go~: Try to cast a ~float~ to a ~string~.
- ~for-no-bool.go~: While variant of for loop with a condition that isn't
  a bool.
- ~func-call.go~: Function call with arguments of different type than
  function declaration arguments.
- ~func-no-decl.go~: Calling a function that hasn't been declared.
- ~function-already-declared.go~: Trying to declare a function that
  has already been declared.
- ~function-duplicate-param.go~: Trying to declare function with two
  params with same name.
- ~if-bad-init.go~: If with an init statement that does not typecheck
  (assignment of different type).
- ~inc-non-numeric.go~: Increment an expression that doesn't resolve
  to a numeric base type.
- ~index-not-list.go~: Index into something that isn't a slice.
- ~index.go~: Index that does not resolve to an int.
- ~invalid-type-decl.go~: Declare a type mapping to a type that
  doesn't exist.
- ~no-field.go~: Using selector operator on struct that doesn't have
  the field requested.
- ~non-existent-assign.go~: Assigning a variable to a non existent
  variable.
- ~non-existent-decl.go~: Trying to declare a variable of a type that
  doesn't exist.
- ~op-assign.go~: Op-assignment where variable and expression are not
  compatible with operator (i.e. ~int + string~)
- ~print-non-base.go~: Trying to print a non base type.
- ~return-expr.go~: Returning an expression of different type than the
  return type of the function.
- ~return.go~: Return nothing from non-void function.
- ~short-decl-all-decl.go~: Short declaration where all variables on
  LHS are already declared.
- ~short-decl-diff-type.go~: Short declaration where already defined
  variables on LHS are not the same type as assigned expression.
- ~switch-diff-type.go~: Type of expression of case is different from
  switch expression type.
- ~type-already-declared.go~: Trying to define a type mapping to a
  type that already exists.
- ~var-already-declared.go~: Trying to declare a variable that is
  already declared.
