\section{Language and Tool Choices}
\subsection{Implementation Language}
% TODO
% MENTION CODEGEN TOOLS, i.e. Krakatau
For our \texttt{GoLite} compiler, we decided to use \texttt{Haskell} as the
implementation language, as many of the required tasks can be done
more naturally (i.e.\ tree traversal, recursing over self defined
structures, enforcing types, etc.).
\subsection{Tools}
For scanning, we use the program \texttt{Alex}, which is similar to \texttt{flex}
but produces \texttt{Haskell} code instead. We use \texttt{Happy} for parsing,
which resembles \texttt{bison/yacc}. \texttt{Alex} and \texttt{Happy} can be interlinked
nicely, passing on useful information (encompassed through a state monad)
such as the line number, column number, character offset in file, and
error messages.
\subsection{Miscellaneous}
We use Travis CI to build our project on every push to GitHub, as well as
run our tests to make sure that new changes did not break
existing functionality.

There are several other good Haskell scanning/parsing options, such as
\texttt{Megaparsec}. We decided on \texttt{Alex/Happy} because of their syntactic
similarity to \texttt{flex/bison}, which we learned in class.

We use \texttt{stack} to manage our Haskell project and corresponding tests.
We implemented additional tests using the \texttt{hspec} package.

\subsection{Target Language}~%
\section{Scanner}
\subsection{Overview}
% TODO
% ADAPT TO FINAL REPORT
The first step of this milestone was to scan user input into
tokens. Handing of most GoLite tokens was straightforward and
similar to class assignments. In other cases, we had to deal with
some of Go/GoLite's quirkiness when compared to something simple
like \texttt{MiniLang}.

\subsection{Design Decisions}
\subsubsection{Semicolon Insertion}
Semicolon insertion was the first scanning hurdle. To solve
this, we use start codes, a built in feature of \texttt{Alex}, and have
special rules for certain states.

If the last token we scan is something that can take an optional
semicolon, we enter the \(nl\) state, where newlines are transformed into
semicolons after specific tokens. Scanning anything else (that isn't
whitespace or otherwise ignored) returns the scanner to the default
state (\(0\)), where newlines are just ignored.

This solution seems elegant, as we don't have to traverse
the whole stream post-scanning or store context, other than the
start code. It also makes sense to let the scanner handle these
situations automatically, rather than trying to deal with them
in the parsing phase.
\subsubsection{Block comment support}
Block comments cannot be easily scanned using only regular
expressions. One potential solution was to use start codes again
(changing state upon opening a comment). This was ruled out since
it would potentially add a lot more start codes (i.e.\ states), as
we'd have combinatorial possibilities with the newline insertion state
(since block comments spanning newlines should also insert semicolons
when they're optional). Using a state approach would also make it
harder to catch unclosed comment block errors.

Our solution iterates through the scanner's input once we receive an
open comment block and ignore everything until the comment is closed.
If the comment never closes, we can easily emit an error.

To account for semicolon insertion with block comments, we set a
semicolon flag to true if we encounter any new line inside the
block comment, and we insert a semicolon if we're in the
aforementioned newline insertion state.
\paragraph{Adding newlines at the end of the file if they aren't present already}
\texttt{Go} requires a semicolon or newline at the end of function
declarations. Sometimes, there may not be a newline at the end of
a file, so no semicolon insertion occurs, resulting in a parsing error.

In order to correct for this type of file, we enforce a final
newline by appending one if necessary. To do this, the code string
is preprocessed prior to scanning. This is the easiest solution,
as otherwise we would have to try inserting a semicolon if we are in
the \(nl\) state when we encounter an \texttt{EOF}, while also making sure
to return an \texttt{EOF}. This would be difficult without additional
context information.
\subsubsection{Nicer error messages}
We decided to use \texttt{ErrorBundle} from \texttt{Megaparsec} in order to
output nicer error messages, with program context for easier
debugging from an end-user programming perspective:

\begin{verbatim}
Error: parsing error, unexpected ) at 5:22:
  |
5 | func abstract(a, b, c) {
  |                      ^
\end{verbatim}

With \texttt{Alex}' default behaviour, we did not have access to the entire
source file string, as it is not kept between steps. In order to
generate the contextual message, we modified the \texttt{monad} wrapper
provided with \texttt{Alex} (see \texttt{TokensBase.hs}) and changed the \texttt{Alex}
monad to wrap over a \texttt{Either (String, Int) a} instead of
\texttt{Either String a}, i.e.\ in addition to storing an error message on
the left side of the monad we also carry an \texttt{Int} which represents
the offset of the error. When we want to print the error
message, we can then append the part in the source file where
the error occurred.

\subsection{Testing}
\section{Parser}
\subsection{Overview}
% TODO
% POTENTIALLY ADD SECTION ABOUT PARSER ROLE LIKE IN SCANNER
\subsection{Design Decisions}
\subsubsection{Grammar}
% TODO
% ACCOUNT FOR COMMENTS IN M1 REPORT
Many of our difficulties in the grammar were associated with identifier and
expression lists, used in declarations/signatures and assignment/function
calls respectively. The grammar was refactored to fix this by allowing
identifier lists to become expression lists if needed, in a way which
avoided introducing other conflicts.

The first issue we encountered was with list ordering. LR parsers
work more intuitively with rules that put the newly-created terminal
after the recursively-expanding non-terminal. However, since Haskell
uses recursive lists defined in the opposite way, it is significantly
more efficient to prepend items. This prepending results in a reversed
ordering, which must be handled after the list is `complete'.

Adding an extra non terminal to manage reversals for each list would
needlessly increase our grammar and generated code size, so we decided
against it as a solution. The solution we use is to differentiate
lists containing at least one non-identifier expression (i.e.\ using either
all non-identifiers, identifiers plus one non-identifier, or otherwise mixed
lists, as grammar base cases) from lists of entirely identifiers. Then,
the expression list non-terminal is allowed to yield either a mixed list
or a pure identifier list depending on what is needed.

Another caveat of how lists are handled in the grammar, again a
compromise to prevent ambiguity, is that the actual grammar constructs
that represent lists correspond to a list of size two or more, which
doesn't exactly match the Go spec (where a list may be 0/1 or more,
depending on the case). The actual single-item non-terminals are allowed
to represent a list of size one when needed, meaning this disparity
is resolved in the actual AST construct, which is closer to a direct
representation of the Go / GoLite specifications.
\subsubsection{AST}
% TODO
% ACCOUNT FOR M1 COMMENTS
We modeled our AST as close as possible to the actual Go and
GoLite specs, to try and ensure that impossible states are inherently
prevented by the Haskell type checker, reducing run-time errors.
Although we don't have type-checking implemented at this milestone,
we can use this technique to enforce definitions such as
`exactly one', `one or more', and `zero or one'. This modeling is
not always perfect. For example, a \href{https://golang.org/ref/spec\#IdentifierList}{list}
of identifiers is `one or more' (in Haskell, \texttt{NonEmpty}). Many locations
make it optional. While a direct translation would be \texttt{Maybe (NonEmpty a)},
we choose to make it a possibly empty list \texttt{[a]} as it makes more sense.
\paragraph{Simplified Data Type Categories}
Some splits, such as \texttt{add\_op} and \texttt{mul\_op} are distinguished
purely to demonstrate precedence; they are in fact only used once
in the specs, so we decide to merge them directly in our \texttt{ArithmOp}
model. Several other instances exist.

Given we are creating an AST, rather than a CST, we can further
compact parts of the grammar. For instance, an \texttt{if} clause in the
spec leads to an \texttt{IfStmt} construction, whose \texttt{else} body is either
a block (with surrounding braces) or another \texttt{if} statement (no
surrounding braces). In our case, we don't need to model the braces,
so we can treat the \texttt{else} body exclusively as \texttt{Stmt} rather than
the more verbose \texttt{Either Block IfStmt}. The grammar enforces that
this \texttt{Stmt} is not any other type.

this \texttt{Stmt} is not any other type.
\paragraph{Structure Simplification}
For \texttt{var} and \texttt{type} declaration, we make no distinction between
single declaration (exactly one) and block declaration (0 or
more). Unlike types, which produce different formats, we decide to
enforce all declarations of one var to be single declaration. In
other words, \texttt{var ( a = 2 )} would become \texttt{var a = 2}. Note that
we cannot further simplify group declarations \texttt{var ( a, b = 2,
	3)}, as there is no guarantee at this stage that the number of
identifiers matches the number of values.
\subsubsection{Pretty Printer}
When creating our pretty printer, we chose a top down approach.
Every node has the ability to output a list of strings, which makes
it easier to format indentation. Each node is also only concerned
with its respective subtree, and does not require context from its
parent. We focused on aesthetics, focusing on proper spacing and
alignments. In the case of expressions, we tried to add brackets
sparingly, though further optimizations can be done down the road
(a nested binary op does not always need brackets, if the order of
precedence matches). To produce the full program, we simply join
the list of strings in the full program, intercalated with new lines.

\subsection{Testing}
\section{Weeder}
\subsection{Overview}
\subsection{Design Decisions}
% TODO
% M2 WEEDING
Most of the weeding operations needed are simple and don't rely
on external context. As a result, we were able to define recursive
traversal methods to verify relevant statements, and create verifiers
that validate at a single level. Haskell helped immensely here, as
we were able to use pattern matching to produce performant and
independent functions.

For verification where statement context was important (\texttt{break} and
\texttt{continue}) we made a simple modification to the recursive traversal
to avoid exploring scopes under \texttt{for} or \texttt{switch} statements
where applicable.

Each verifier returns an optional error, and we are able to map the
results and return the first error, if any.
