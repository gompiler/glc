This document is for jotting down quick notes of our meetings an
discussions and is not the design document (although many parts of
here will formally be included in said document).
\section{\textit{<2019-02-11 Mon>}}
\label{sec:orgb90db55}
\subsection{Comparison of Allan and Julian's Methods of Writing a Compiler in Haskell}
\label{sec:org3c287fb}
\subsubsection{Compared Parsing Methods (Megaparsec vs Alex \(\to\) Happy)}
\label{sec:orgd73319a}
\begin{itemize}
\item Alex/Happy is much more similar to Flex/Bison
\begin{itemize}
\item Will be easier for David
\end{itemize}
\item Could generate tokens with Alex and feed them to Megaparsec
\begin{itemize}
\item This would be more difficult as we'd have to learn how to use
Megaparsec in new ways (i.e. with a token stream)
\end{itemize}
\item Megaparsec errors are much nicer
\begin{itemize}
\item However, they only require the input string and the offset, all of
which can be obtained from Alex if using the linepos or monadic wrapper
\end{itemize}
\item Simplest approach would be to use Alex/Happy
\begin{itemize}
\item Mainly have David and Julian work on scanning \& parsing since they
are familiar with the toolsets/style
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Miscellaneous Implementation Comparisons}
\label{sec:org80c913b}
\begin{itemize}
\item For command line parsing, we will use \texttt{Optparse.applicative}
\item The symbol table will be implemented using a mutable hashtable
(rather than immutable)
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Discussion of Project Name}
\label{sec:org2fc3b68}
\begin{itemize}
\item Settled on \texttt{glc} as package/executable name
\item Project name is either Gophiler, Gompiler or Gopiler
\begin{itemize}
\item Settled on Gompiler
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Start of Scanner}
\label{sec:org62150bc}
\begin{itemize}
\item Discussed how we wanted the token type to be represented
\begin{itemize}
\item Split into multiple categories or just one type with each token?
\begin{itemize}
\item Categories would be:
\begin{itemize}
\item Keywords
\item Operators
\item Literals
\item Identifiers
\item Semicolons
\end{itemize}
\item Decided there is no point in separating tokens as we won't see
them after we parse anyway
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Started implementing Scanner in Alex (Julian)
\begin{itemize}
\item Scanning branch
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
