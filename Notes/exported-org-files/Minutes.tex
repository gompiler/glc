\section{\textit{<2019-02-11 Mon>}}
\label{sec:orgb85eef1}
\subsection{Comparison of Allan and Julian's Methods of Writing a Compiler in Haskell}
\label{sec:orgf2049b8}
\subsubsection{Compared Parsing Methods (Megaparsec vs Alex \(\to\) Happy)}
\label{sec:orgda91efb}
\begin{itemize}
\item Alex/Happy is much more similar to Flex/Bison
\begin{itemize}
\item Will be easier for David
\end{itemize}
\item Could generate tokens with Alex and feed them to Megaparsec
\begin{itemize}
\item This would be more difficult as we'd have to learn how to use
Megaparsec in new ways (i.e. with a token stream)
\end{itemize}
\item Megaparsec errors are much nicer
\begin{itemize}
\item However, they only require the input string and the offset, all of
which can be obtained from Alex if using the linepos or monadic wrapper
\end{itemize}
\item Simplest approach would be to use Alex/Happy
\begin{itemize}
\item Mainly have David and Julian work on scanning \& parsing since they
are familiar with the toolsets/style
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Miscellaneous Implementation Comparisons}
\label{sec:orgf3a9dc3}
\begin{itemize}
\item For command line parsing, we will use \texttt{Optparse.applicative}
\item The symbol table will be implemented using a mutable hashtable
(rather than immutable)
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Discussion of Project Name}
\label{sec:orgdad2c16}
\begin{itemize}
\item Settled on \texttt{glc} as package/executable name
\item Project name is either Gophiler, Gompiler or Gopiler
\begin{itemize}
\item Settled on Gompiler
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
